Hello! I am a postdoctoral fellow at [CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/), Northwestern University. 

My research interests include exoplanetary dynamics, protoplanetary disks, and the dynamical evolution of embedded black holes in active galactic nucleus disks. I primarily study theories in these topics using <i>N</i>-body and hydrodynamics simulations. Please check out the [Research page](https://lijiaru0305.github.io/publications/) for more details.

I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from Cornell University, where I was a student of Professor Dong Lai. I also spent two years at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a CSES student fellow. I received my bachelor's degree in 2017 from the University of Toronto at Scarborough, where I worked with Prof. Artur Izmaylov on quantum chemistry. 

Before I started my university studies, I was born and raised in Hangzhou, China.
