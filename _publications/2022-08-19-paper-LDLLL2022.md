<b>Abstract:</b> In contrast to the conventional pictures of gravitational-wave captures, three-body scatterings, and dynamical-friction-assisted captures, we find that black hole (BH) binaries can be formed in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks by a so-called departure drag. We study the close encounters between two single BHs embedded in an AGN disk using a series of global 2D hydrodynamics simulations. The close encounters in some simulations lead to the formation of bound BH binaries, while the others do not. Our analysis demonstrates that, after a BH pair passes the pericenter of their relative trajectory, a gas departure drag may slow down the BHs, possibly forcing the two BHs to stay tightly bound. We provide a fitting formula that can accurately predict whether a close encounter can form a binary based on the gas mass and the incoming energy of the encounter. A binary formed by a close encounter can have compact a semi-major axis, large eccentricity, and retrograde revolution. If a close encounter does not form a binary, the BHs are scattered to more spatially separated orbits.  Their orbital eccentricity around the SMBH will get damped quickly by the AGN disk. Our fitting formula for the binary formation criteria can be easily implemented in other long-term simulations that study the dynamical evolution of BHs in AGN disks. The results of the orbital elements of binaries produced by close encounters suggest interesting initial conditions to be considered in other studies investigating the evolution of pre-existing binaries embedded in AGN disk.
